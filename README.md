In recent years, multimodal benchmarks for general domains have guided the rapid development of multimodal models on general tasks. However, the financial field has its peculiarities. It features unique graphical images (e.g., candlestick charts, technical indicator charts) and possesses a wealth of specialized financial knowledge (e.g., futures, turnover rate).
    
Benchmarks from general fields often fail to measure the performance of multimodal models in the financial domain, and thus cannot effectively guide the rapid development of large financial models. To promote the development of large financial multimodal models, we propose <strong>MME-Finance</strong>, an bilingual open-ended and practical usage-oriented Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark. 

## 📢 News 
- 🚀 [11/05/2024] We released <strong>MME-Finance</strong> benchmark, a bilingual multimodal benchmark in financial domain.
- 🚀 [01/08/2025] <strong>We have released all samples in both English and Chinese.</strong>

## 💡 Highlights
- 🔥 <strong>Bilingual multimodal financial benchmark:</strong> MME-Finance is the first Bilingual multimodal financial benchmark which comprises 1,171 English and 1,103 Chinese open-ended questions, covering diverse financial image types and various multimodal capabilities. 
- 🔥 <strong>Evaluation strategy: </strong> MME-Finance proposes a Elaborate evaluation strategy that taking image into consideration, and has a high consistency with humans. It can serve as a reference for evaluating MLLMs for other works.
- 🔥 <strong>Valuable insights: </strong>We conduct extensive evaluation on 19 MLLMs based on MME-Finance, revealing critical insights about the strengths and shortcomings of the current MLLMs in financial applications.


## 🛠️ Usage

<!-- ### Judgement -->
We have integrated MMfin into the VLMEvalKit framework. For the environment configuration and the use of API, please refer to [VLMEvalKit](https://github.com/open-compass/VLMEvalKit).
Regarding the data, first of all, you should download the `MMfin.tsv` and `MMfin_CN.tsv` files, as well as the relevant financial images. The folder structure is shown as follows:
```
├─ datasets
    ├─ images
        ├─ MMfin
            ...
        ├─ MMfin_CN
            ...
    │ MMfin.tsv
    │ MMfin_CN.tsv
```
The following is the process of inference and evaluation (Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct as an example):
```
export LMUData="The path of the datasets"
python run.py --data MMfin --model Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct --verbose
python run.py --data MMfin_CN --model Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct --verbose
```
